Recognize a Hand Written digits Using Deeplearning (Building a Simple Neural Network)
This Project Basically tells us how we feed image into Neural Network. Image is Ultimately a two Dimensional Matrix where each pixel is represented between 0 & 255, where Zero is Black & 255 is White & inbetween there is a Number. Those pixel as a two dimensional array where the darker or empty layer has zero & bright region has a maximum of 255 & you get two dimensional array.we can convert that two dimension array into one dimension array by flattening technique. The Code bascially give an idea about the simple Neural Netwotk model without any layer & later we add an layer in order to increase the accuracy of prediction of our Neural Network Model.
